## About this website

I made this website in the mid-2000s when I was in high school. I started by registering the xoid.us domain on Yahoo Domains and started hosting stuff on there. 
As a high schooler, I didn't have a credit card at the time, so I had to surreptitiously purchase prepaid visa cards from Safeway and use those to fund the domain and hosting costs.
My dad eventually found out about my prepaid visa card maneuvers (through a carelessly discarded Safeway receipt), and was mad at me for 1) doing sketchy money funneling and 2) getting ripped off by Yahoo domains.
He offered to move the site onto his domain and hosting provider, and I reluctantly/gratefully agreed.

For the actual website contents, I first stole some guy's cool digital artwork of a beach, screen-capped it, and threw that as my background. I then spent an excessive amount of time coding the entire menu bar in 
(what I thought was) efficient javascript. In addition, with all the php installers of cPanel (from my dad's hosting) at my disposal, I also added a bunch of flash games and attempted to start a forum. This was my first and only
blatant get-rich-off-adsense scheme, one that ultimately failed because nobody ever visited my website. 

In retrospect, the high school years were very formative for me. With no idea how to do anything web related, I floundered around A LOT on google, and in doing so, I slowly but surely honed my google search skills. After hundreds of google searches all
 pointing me to the same place, I realized w3schools was pretty useful, and started going straight there for most things... and I learned the value of documentation. And for debugging.. I didn't really have any good tools for it, but I had good old trusty `alert()` on my side and learned about strategic breakpoint placement that way.

During the last few years of college, I decided to retire my old website and try to transform it into something more professional using GitHub pages and Jekyll. I got it started but never really finished it up (I'm trying to clean it up now, several years later).

Hi, my name is Christopher Kodama, I am an electrical engineer who likes to code.  Both my parents are also electrical engineers, and like them, 
I managed to convince the U.S. Air Force to bankroll my college undergraduate and master's degrees, in exchange for my soul and the entirety of my twenties 
(maybe more, we'll see).

I made this website in the mid-2000s when I was in high school. To be specific, that's when I registered the xoid.us domain on Yahoo Domains and started hosting stuff on there. 
As a high schooler, I didn't have a credit card at the time, so I had to surreptitiously purchase prepaid visa cards from Safeway and use those to fund the domain and hosting costs.
My dad eventually found out about my prepaid visa card maneuvers (through a carelessly discarded Safeway receipt), and was mad at me for 1) doing sketchy money funneling and 2) getting ripped off by Yahoo domains.
He offered to move the site onto his domain and hosting provider, and I reluctantly/gratefully agreed.

For the actual website contents, I first stole some guy's cool digital artwork of a beach, screen-capped it, and threw that as my background. I then spent an excessive amount of time coding the entire menu bar in 
(what I thought was) efficient javascript. In addition, with all the php installers of cPanel (from my dad's hosting) at my disposal, I also added a bunch of flash games and attempted to start a forum. This was my first and only
blatant get-rich-off-adsense scheme, one that ultimately failed because nobody ever visited my website. 

In retrospect, the high school years were very formative for me. With no idea how to do anything web related, I floundered around A LOT on google, and in doing so, I slowly but surely honed my google search skills. After hundreds of google searches all
 pointing me to the same place, I realized w3schools was pretty useful, and started going straight there for most things... and I learned the value of documentation. And for debugging.. I didn't really have any good tools for it, but I had good old trusty `alert()` on my side and learned about strategic breakpoint placement that way.

I can credit my initial predilection for coding to my dad, who for some unknown reason decided to try to teach me Java when I was around twelve or so. 
The book he got for me (from the library) was called "Head First Java," and it had just enough silly pictures in it to keep 12-year-old me engaged enough to learn the basic
concepts in the first half of the book. I like to think that the fundamentals I learned carried over into my high school programming experiences, which included not only my wild west web development, 
but also some simple Arduino programming for an A.P. Physics lesson, and some ungodly excel formulas in a spreadsheet for an aerodynamics design competition.

College is where I started getting comfortable with a lot of different languages, like C, Python, and more Java. I also learned learned Matlab and Verilog too, for what it's worth.  
Since I was an electrical engineer and not a computer science major, most of my coding projects were short and were means to an end for other stuff, like programming a microcontroller or writing short scripts to parse data.  
During the last few years of college, I decided to retire my old website and try to transform it into something more professional using GitHub pages and Jekyll. I got it started but never really finished it up (I'm trying to clean it up now, six years later).

When I moved on to start working in the Air Force, I took the "programming is a means to an end" mentality with me as I worked on interesting projects, and learned to make use of whatever programming tools were available to me.
My first assignment was a great first experience because all our main analysis work had to be done on linux machines. I got used to navigating UNIX environments, and my primary tools of the trade ended up being bash, sed/awk, and perl, with some actual git version control for the first time (for me and for the project). 
I also started more consciously documenting my programming projects, in many cases creating blog posts to record everything that I did. A major motivating factor for this was because every time I dusted off an old project, I completely forgot everything I did and had to start googling from scratch just to get oriented.

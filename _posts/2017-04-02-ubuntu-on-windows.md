Wow, haven't updated blog in like two years. Right now I am trying to install gedit on the "Ubuntu on Windows" feature of Windows 10. I was able to get it installed with "sudo apt-get install gedit," but it still wasn't working correctly... something about a gconf file not working. I wasn't able to change any of my preferences! After googling the problem for about two hours, I think my issue is that I haven't installed gnome yet! I guess that's a required thing, considering that gedit is a gnome application. 

Reddit's april fools joke has been to make a giant paint canvas for users to paint on. I have also been working a bit on making a tool that makes it easier for people to collaborate on making art pieces for that (/pixel-places/).

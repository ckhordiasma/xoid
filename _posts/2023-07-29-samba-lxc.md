title: Hosting a Samba Server on LXC
date: 2023-07-29

Setting up an SMB server in a Proxmox LXC can be a little tricky if you want to do it the "safe" way in a non-privileged container. I put together some notes on how I set up my instance.

## on proxmox gui
create an unprivileged container for your samba.

## On proxmox host

`groupadd` the groups that you want exposed to the samba server. take note of their GIDs. In my case I wanted to have gid 2000 and gid 2001

```
groupadd -g 2000 samba-group-A
groupadd -g 2001 samba-group-B
```

add the following into the lxc configuration for your samba container
```
# map: from container id range 0 to (0 + 2000 -1) get mapped to host ids starting at 100000
lxc.idmap:  0 100000 2000
# map: from container id range 2000 to (2000 + 2 -1) get mapped to host ids starting at 2000
lxc.idmap:  2000 2000 2
# map: from container id range 2002 to (2002 + 63534 -1) (i.e. 65535) get mapped to host ids starting at 102002
lxc.idmap:  2002 102002 63534

lxc.idmap: 0 100000 65535 # shift all users up 100k without mapping anything special
```

If you already folders on the host, assign a user to your samba groups `usermod -aG samba-group-A samba-user` 

and then set your files to that user/group `chown samba-user:samba-group-A my_files` or `chgrp -R samba-group-A my_files`
and set the directory to default to that group `chmod g+s -R my_files`
and remove directory permissions for non group people `chmod o-rwx -R my_files`

also add the following into your lxc config to bind mount

```
mp1: /tank/share,mp=/media/share
mp2: /tank/share2,mp=/media/share2
```

edit the /etc/subgid file on host
root:2000:2

## on the samba container, as container root

use the same commands as before to create the same groups with same gid

create some users that are members of those groups (-M ensures a home directory isn't created)

```
useradd -M -G samba-group-A,samba-group-B roberto
useradd -M -G samba-group-A,samba-group-B diana
useradd -M -G samba-group-A smb-share-user
```

now you should be able to view files using `sudo -u roberto ls /media/share/`

## setting up samba on container

`apt-get install samba`

edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to your liking

```
[Global]

comment = alternate share

browseable = yes
path = /media/share2
guest ok = no
read only = no
valid users = @samba-group-B 
spotlight backend = elasticsearch
```

run `systemctl enable samba` `systemctl start samba`

add users to samba:

```
smbpasswd -a roberto
smbpasswd -a diana
smbpasswd -a smb-share-user
```

start ufw and allow samba:

```
ufw enable
ufw allow Samba
ufw status
```


# how to mount to this samba server
example fstab to connect to this samba server

```
//samba.server.url/share /media/share cifs vers=3.0,credentials=/root/share-credentials,uid=1002,gid=2000 0 0
```

note that the uid of the user (`smb-share-user` in this case) matches what it would be in the samba container, and the group matches the samba-group-A group.

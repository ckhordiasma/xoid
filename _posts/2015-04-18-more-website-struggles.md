I'm trying to make jekyll on github pages work nicely with my website host, and it's rather confusing.  I thought I had it all figured out yesterday, but I decided to do something else so I've been working on that for the past few hours. I want the jekyll site to appear at www.xoid.us, but I want all my old stuff to appear somewhere, like old.xoid.us. 
But in the process of doing that,  I suddenly was unable to access my cpanel, or any non-jekyll part of my site!  Pinging it did not work!  But wait!  If I check the status of the website on sites like site24x7.com, it shows that it works.  I just tried opening the site on my phone's 4G internet connection, and it works.  So I think that the hosting company may have blocked my IP address for some reason... So anyways, I finished up the DNS editing on my phone, and now I think everything works as I expected!
